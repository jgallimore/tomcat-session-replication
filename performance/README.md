### Performance Test

This is a performance project that you can use to test the environments. Make sure you already started one environment in the 'environments' module.

To run a performance test just run ./grinder.sh and then in the UI click "Start the worker processes" icon.

After that the grinder should run for 60s which is the default value for the grinder. If you want to raise the time go grinder.sh and change the config 'grinder.duration' to the number you want in millisecond.
